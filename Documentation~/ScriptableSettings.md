# Coimbra Framework: Scriptable Settings

    Under construction

Easily access a `ScriptableObject` from anywhere with option to preload those on the application startup.

You can also make them appear in the project settings with `ProjectSettingsAttribute` or in the preferences with `PreferencesAttribute`.

You can see all the currently loaded `ScriptableSettings` in `Window/Coimbra Framework/Scriptable Settings`.
